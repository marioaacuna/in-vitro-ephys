# In-vitro Ephys
This project includes scripts to analyze in vitro ephys data
# INTRO
This pipeline runs on MATLAB. it will help you analyse in vitro electrophysiological data obtainedin the Nevian Lab. This pipeline was created and is mantained by Mario A. AcuÃ±a. If you have questions, please ask him (mario.acuna@unibe.ch)
So far we can analyse:
# 
- SAG properties
- AP features
- Pairing analysis
- Evoked EPSPs
- Evoked EPSCs
- Paired-pulse ratios
- EPSP summation.
- In future releases:- Spontaneous EPSCs 
(the detailed information about each of them will come in a future release)

# How to set up your ephys analysis pipeline:
	- login to: https://gitlab.com/nevian_group_unibe/in-vitro-ephys
	- click on Clone -> copy https link
	- go to the folder where you have all re repos:
		- Mouse right click and select 'clone'
		- It should appear what you copied already as the default https link to clone
		- And as simple as that you will have the ephys analysis on your repo folder
		
# How to run Ephys analysis
	- open Matlab
	- Create a favorite script:
		- Home > favorite > new favorite
		- give it a name Label:'run_epyhs', or so
		Code:
		
```matlab 
% This is what you will have to write
% copy and paste this code
close all force hidden; 
clc;
clear;
cd('PATH/TO/YOUR/REPO') % To be changed (add in repository)
run_in_vitro_ephys_analysis()
```
#
	- This will run an app where you can select what to analyse
		- For AP analysis, a new app will open and you have to select the experimenter name
		- Then choose all the other parameters you see on the app
		- For all the other analysis, follow the same logic
		
# That's it! enjoy!
